# Algorithms Directory

The **Algorithms** directory is intended to store C++ files related to algorithm implementations and data structures. This directory focuses on the logic and computational aspects of the project.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **Algorithms** directory:

1. Each C++ file should contain one or more algorithm implementations or data structures.
2. Use clear and descriptive names for the files, reflecting the purpose or algorithm implemented.
3. Ensure that the files are properly documented with comments explaining the algorithm's logic, input/output specifications, and any relevant details.
4. Include a README file in any subdirectories within the **Algorithms** directory to provide additional information if necessary.

## Usage

Here are some common types of files you might find in the **Algorithms** directory:

1. **Sorting algorithms**: Files that implement various sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
2. **Searching algorithms**: Files that contain implementations of searching algorithms such as Binary Search, Linear Search, or Hashing.
3. **Data structures**: Files that define and implement commonly used data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.
4. **Dynamic programming**: Files containing algorithms that solve problems using dynamic programming techniques.
5. **Graph algorithms**: Files that implement algorithms for graph-related operations, such as breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), and various graph traversal algorithms.
6. **Optimization algorithms**: Files that focus on optimization problems and algorithms like Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, or Particle Swarm Optimization.

Feel free to create subdirectories within the **Algorithms** directory to further categorize the files based on your project's specific needs.

Happy coding!
