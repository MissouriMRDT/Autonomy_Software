# Vision Directory

The **Vision** directory is intended to store C++ files related to computer vision and image processing functionalities in the Rover project. This directory focuses on algorithms and techniques used for visual perception and analysis.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **Vision** directory:

1. Each C++ file should contain one or more computer vision algorithms, image processing techniques, or related functionalities.
2. Use descriptive names for the files that reflect the purpose or functionality of the vision-related code.
3. Ensure that the files are properly documented with comments explaining the algorithms, techniques, or methods used, as well as input/output specifications and any relevant details.
4. Include a README file in any subdirectories within the **Vision** directory to provide additional information if necessary.

## Usage

Here are some common types of files you might find in the **Vision** directory:

1. **Image processing algorithms**: Files that implement various image processing operations such as filtering, edge detection, color manipulation, or feature extraction.
2. **Object detection and tracking**: Files that focus on detecting and tracking objects within images or video streams using techniques like Haar cascades, template matching, or deep learning-based approaches.
3. **Image recognition and classification**: Files that utilize machine learning or deep learning models to recognize and classify objects or patterns in images.
4. **Camera calibration**: Files that handle camera calibration procedures, distortion correction, and intrinsic/extrinsic parameter estimation.
5. **Pose estimation**: Files that estimate the 3D pose or position of objects or the Rover itself based on visual information.
6. **Stereo vision**: Files that implement stereo vision techniques, such as disparity mapping or depth estimation, using multiple cameras or image pairs.
7. **Augmented reality**: Files that combine computer vision with augmented reality techniques, overlaying virtual objects or information onto the real-world environment.

Feel free to create subdirectories within the **Vision** directory to further categorize the files based on specific vision-related tasks or techniques.

Remember to update this README file whenever new vision-related files are added to the directory, providing a brief summary of each file's purpose and functionality.

Ensure that the vision-related code is properly integrated with other components of the project to enable visual perception and analysis for the Rover.

Happy coding and exploring the world with vision!
