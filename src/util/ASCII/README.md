# ASCII Directory

The **ASCII** directory is intended to store Text files that provide software headers for the rover project.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **ASCII** directory:

1. Each Text file should contain "Autonomy Software" followed by the major software version. Example: `Autonomy Software v24`
2. Use https://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Small to create your text file to match the formatting from past years.

Remember to update this README file whenever new ASCII files are added to the directory, providing a brief summary of each file's purpose and functionality.

Utilize the utility files throughout the project to streamline development, improve code reusability, and enhance overall project efficiency.

Happy coding and utilizing the utilities!
