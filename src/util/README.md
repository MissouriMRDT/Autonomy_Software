# Util Directory

The **Util** directory is intended to store C++ files that provide utility functions and helper classes for the Rover project. This directory focuses on reusable code snippets and functionalities that can be used across different modules.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **Util** directory:

1. Each C++ file should contain one or more utility functions, helper classes, or modules that provide common functionalities.
2. Use descriptive names for the files that reflect the purpose or functionality of the utilities.
3. Ensure that the files are properly documented with comments explaining the usage, input/output specifications, and any relevant details.
4. Include a README file in any subdirectories within the **Util** directory to provide additional information if necessary.

## Usage

Here are some common types of files you might find in the **Util** directory:

1. **Math utilities**: Files that contain mathematical functions or algorithms commonly used in the Rover project, such as vector operations, coordinate transformations, or statistical calculations.
2. **File utilities**: Files that provide functions for file handling, reading/writing data, or managing file paths within the project.
3. **Logging utilities**: Files that implement logging mechanisms to capture and store relevant information or debug messages during runtime.
4. **Configuration utilities**: Files that handle project configurations, settings, or parameter management, allowing for easy customization and adaptability.
5. **Data processing utilities**: Files that offer functions for data manipulation, filtering, or formatting, to prepare data for further analysis or usage within the project.
6. **Time and date utilities**: Files that provide functions for time and date operations, conversions, or scheduling tasks in the Rover project.
7. **Networking utilities**: Files that handle network-related operations, such as socket communication, HTTP requests, or network configuration.

Feel free to create subdirectories within the **Util** directory to further categorize the files based on the specific utility or functionality they provide.

Remember to update this README file whenever new utility files are added to the directory, providing a brief summary of each file's purpose and functionality.

Utilize the utility files throughout the project to streamline development, improve code reusability, and enhance overall project efficiency.

Happy coding and utilizing the utilities!
