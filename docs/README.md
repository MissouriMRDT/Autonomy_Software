# Docs Directory

The **Docs** directory is intended to store documentation files and resources for the Rover project. This directory focuses on providing comprehensive and accessible documentation to guide developers, users, and contributors.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **Docs** directory:

1. Use commonly accepted documentation formats such as Markdown, HTML, or plain text to create the documentation files.
2. Organize the documentation files based on their purpose or target audience, such as "User Guide," "Developer Documentation," or "API Reference."
3. Include a README file in the **Docs** directory to provide an overview of the available documentation and instructions for accessing or navigating through it.
4. Consider using a documentation generator tool or framework to streamline the creation and maintenance of the documentation.

## Usage

Here are some common types of files or directories you might find within the **Docs** directory:

1. **User Guide**: Directory containing documentation files that provide instructions, tutorials, or usage examples for users of the Rover project.
2. **Developer Documentation**: Directory containing documentation files that explain the internals, architecture, design patterns, or development guidelines for contributors or developers working on the Rover project.
3. **API Reference**: Directory containing documentation files that detail the application programming interfaces (APIs) provided by the Rover project, including function signatures, input/output specifications, and usage examples.
4. **Troubleshooting**: Directory containing documentation files that address common issues, errors, or frequently asked questions related to the Rover project.
5. **Release Notes**: File or directory containing release notes or changelogs that document the changes, bug fixes, and new features introduced in different versions of the Rover project.

## Generating Documentation

1. Run `doxygen` from the workspace root directory and doxygen will automatically generate the output files to the docs/Doxygen directory.
2. Open the `index.html` file to view the generated documentation site locally in a browser.

NOTE: Depending on your machine, you may need to update the user permissions or owner of the generated files before you can properly view them.

Remember to update this README file whenever new documentation files or resources are added to the **Docs** directory, providing a brief summary of each document's purpose and content.

Regularly review and update the documentation to ensure its accuracy, relevance, and completeness.

Provide clear instructions to users and contributors on how to access and navigate the documentation to promote a better understanding and adoption of the Rover project.

Happy documenting and sharing knowledge!
