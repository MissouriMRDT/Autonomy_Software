# Unit Tests Directory

The **Unit Tests** directory is intended to store C++ files containing test cases and unit tests for the Rover project. This directory focuses on ensuring the correctness and reliability of the code through systematic testing.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **Unit Tests** directory:

1. Each C++ file should contain one or more test cases or unit tests for specific functionalities, modules, or components of the Rover project.
2. Use descriptive names for the files that reflect the purpose or functionality being tested.
3. Ensure that the test files are properly documented with comments explaining the test cases, their expected outcomes, and any relevant details.
4. Include a README file in the **Unit Tests** directory to provide an overview of the testing framework used, instructions for running the tests, and any additional information.

## Usage

1. Create a folder for the integration test and then include `.cc` files for each test suite.
2. Look at the `Example.cc` file located in `/tests/` to see how the test suite should be setup.

Organize the test files in a way that mirrors the structure of the project's codebase, making it easy to locate and execute the relevant tests.

Remember to update this README file whenever new test files are added to the directory, providing a brief summary of each file's purpose and functionality.

Regularly run the tests to identify and address any potential issues or bugs, ensuring the overall quality and reliability of the Rover project.

Happy testing and maintaining code quality!
