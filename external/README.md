# External Directory

The **External** directory is intended to store external dependencies, libraries, or third-party modules used in the Rover project. This directory focuses on organizing and managing external code or resources that are required for the project's functionality.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **External** directory:

1. Store the external dependencies or libraries as separate directories within the **External** directory.
2. Use the name of each external dependency or library as the directory name, or use a common convention for grouping related dependencies.
3. Include any necessary license files or documentation provided with the external dependencies.
4. Include a README file in each subdirectory within the **External** directory to provide information on the purpose and usage of the external dependency.

## Usage

Here are some common types of files or directories you might find within the **External** directory:

1. **Library A**: Directory containing all the files and resources related to "Library A," which is an external library used in the Rover project.
2. **Library B**: Directory containing all the files and resources related to "Library B," another external library utilized in the Rover project.
3. **Framework C**: Directory containing the necessary files and resources for "Framework C," a third-party framework used in the Rover project.
4. **Resources**: Directory containing additional resources, such as datasets or configuration files, used by the external dependencies in the Rover project.

Remember to update this README file whenever new external dependencies or libraries are added to the **External** directory, providing a brief summary of each dependency's purpose and functionality.

Ensure that the external dependencies are properly integrated and used within the Rover project, adhering to any licensing or usage requirements.

Happy coding and leveraging external resources!
