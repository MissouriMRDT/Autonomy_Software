# Data Directory

The **Data** directory is intended to store data files and resources used in the rover project. This directory focuses on organizing and managing various types of data that are essential for the project's functionality, analysis, or training.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **Data** directory:

1. Store data files in a structured manner based on their purpose, type, or source.
2. Use descriptive names for the files that reflect their content or purpose.
3. Consider creating subdirectories within the **Data** directory to further categorize the data based on specific criteria or usage.
4. Include a README file in the **Data** directory or subdirectories to provide additional information about the data files, their format, or any relevant details.

## Usage

Here are some common types of data files or directories you might find within the **Data** directory:

1. **Sensor data**: Files containing data collected from sensors used in the rover project, such as images, lidar scans, accelerometer readings, or GPS coordinates.
2. **Training data**: Files or directories containing data used for training machine learning or deep learning models in the rover project, including labeled datasets, feature vectors, or preprocessed inputs.
3. **Configuration files**: Files containing configuration data or settings used by different components or modules of the rover project, such as calibration parameters, control parameters, or environment specifications.
4. **Map data**: Files or directories containing map data, terrain models, or elevation data used for navigation or path planning in the rover project.
5. **Simulation data**: Files containing simulated data used for testing or validating the rover project in simulated environments.
6. **Log files**: Files or directories containing log data captured during the execution or operation of the rover project, providing valuable information for debugging, analysis, or performance evaluation.

Remember to update this README file whenever new data files or resources are added to the **Data** directory, providing a brief summary of each data file's purpose and content.

Ensure that the data files are appropriately integrated with the project's code and workflows, enabling easy access and usage when required.

Manage the data files carefully, keeping backups and ensuring compliance with any data protection or privacy regulations.

Happy organizing and utilizing the data!
