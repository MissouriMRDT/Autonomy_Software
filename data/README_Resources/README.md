# README_Resources Directory

The **README_Resources** directory is intended to store any images or other media files that are referenced by README.md files within the Rover project.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **README_Resources** directory:

1. Any image file should be placed in the images folder and contain a descriptive name that does not contain spaces. Example: `my_descriptive_image.png`
2. Any video file should be placed in the videos folder and container a descriptive namethat does not contain spaces. Example: `my_descriptive_video.png` 

Remember to update this README file whenever new folders/types of media are added to the directory, providing a brief summary of each file's purpose and functionality.

Happy coding and resource creating!
