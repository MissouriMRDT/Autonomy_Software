# models Directory

The **models** directory is intended to store any machine learning models or other neural network related files that are referenced or used by the Autonomy_Software project.

## Guidelines

The following are the guidelines for organizing files within the **models** directory:

1. All models and their respective files should be placed within their own, properly labeled folder.
2. An `info.txt` file should be created within the folder. This file will contain the type of model, where it was obtained, what dataset it was trained off of, etc.
If necessary the dimensions of the input and output and any other important information about the intermediate layers of the model should also be documented.

Happy coding and model training!
